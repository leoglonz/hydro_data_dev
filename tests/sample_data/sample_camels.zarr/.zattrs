It just has more maximum and minimum temperatures.We used Dapeng's code to extract the data. The code is available athydroDLFirst of all you need the CAMELS data set, to run any of your code. This data set can be downloaded for free here: CAMELS: Catchment Attributes and Meteorology for Large-sample Studies - Dataset Downloads Make sure to download the CAMELS time series meteorology, observed flow, meta data (.zip) file, as well as the CAMELS Attributes (.zip). Extract the data set on your file system and make sure to put the attribute folder (camels_attributes_v2.0) inside the CAMELS main directory. We trained our models with an updated version of the Maurer and NLDAS forcing data, that is still not published officially (CAMELS data set will be updated soon). The updated versions forcing contain daily minimum and maximum temperature. The original data included in the CAMELS data set only includes daily mean temperature. You can find the updated forcings temporarily here:Updated Maurer forcing with daily minimum and maximum temperature; Updated NLDAS forcing with daily minimum and maximum temperature. Download and extract the updated forcing into the basin_mean_forcing folder of the CAMELS data set and do not rename it (name should be maurer_extended and nldas_extended). Next you need the simulations of all benchmark models. These can be downloaded from HydroShare under the following link:\"}",
